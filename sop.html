						<h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
						<p>&emsp;&emsp;I was born and raised in the age of the Internet, where everything is connected.
						With the world's increasing population and dependence on information technology,
						information systems' security will remain the most important subject in the future.
						During my school years, I have been fascinated by cybersecurity. I took basic computer
						sciences courses and innovative courses such as web design and mobile software
						design to understand how everything worked together and what possibilities are out
						there. I was eager to learn more and learn from the professionals.
						<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;My passion for cybersecurity started when I was a freshman in college. I joined an
						information technology community and attended their summer camp. In the camp, we
						divided into teams to find vulnerabilities and obtain passwords from the server.
						Through teamwork, we gained the most points at this camp. This achievement led me
						to step into the cybersecurity field, and I started to fall in love with it.
						<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In my college years, I spent all day learning information-related technologies and
						actively participated in community volunteer activities. My grades also improved by
						leaps and bounds, which entitled me to the Presidential Award and the internship
						opportunity at a multi-national company recommended by my professor. During the
						internship, I was a system engineer responsible for maintaining servers and assigned
						to the banks' computer room. Also, I was authorized to do the penetration test in the
						company's system to find any service vulnerabilities. My most proud achievement is
						that I found a remote code execution vulnerability based on the structs2 framework in
						the company's services. (CVE-2013-2251), and I suggested a solution and fixed it. This
						experience not only allowed me to know how system engineers communicate with
						colleagues and customers in the real-world but also allow me to experience "how to
						maintain a system."
						<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;My research project at the university involved a mobile web system in enhancing
						the efficiency of a food court. We designed a system to let users use the QR codes or
						physical network devices such as Eddystone to place their order to solve the problems
						of overcrowding with the order line. We won the first prize of TWD 6,000 Taiwan
						dollars (approx. USD200) in a special competition held by the department with this
						system. In the final semester, I obtained first place in class and the membership of Phi
						Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society, a special honor for the first-place owner.
						<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The reason I pursue studying at George Mason University for my master's degree is
						that GMU has the most practical courses like "Penetration Testing Forensics," "Mobile
						Device Forensics," and "Malware Reverse Engineering." The knowledge in these
						courses and even the tools used in the syllabus are things that I have heard in the
						information community but have no chance to learn in schools. Suppose I can study in
						Digital Forensics and Cyber Analysis Program. I will get complete Digital Forensics
						training and obtain the ability to work in the dynamic industry of digital forensics.
						<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;After graduating from GMU, I plan to work in digital forensics because it could let
						me use the knowledge I learned and help people who were being harmed. My
						ultimate professional aspiration is to complete the work perfectly in digital forensics,
						including identifying various digital systems and finding the most useful clues and
						evidence in them. Then helping investigative agencies and judicial systems investigate
						any crime scene to bring people a safer society.</p>
