						<h3>Pathway Reflection</h3>
						<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When I was studying in the pathway program, I took five courses, of which two major courses and 3 are pathway courses.
						In EAP-508, we learned the research process of an academic thesis, from sources finding and use rhetorical elements to
						analyzing the article to complete our final project. Our research topic is about machine learning and disease
						prevention-"The Fight Against Outbreak: Using Machine Learning To Control Covid-19." For me, this is an excellent
						opportunity to learn and experience a process of academic research.
						
						<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In my major courses "Intro to Forensic Technology and Analysis" and "Digital Forensics Analysis," I learned a lot of
						basic knowledge related to digital forensics, from file systems such as NTFS, exFat to the actual analysis of a thumb
						disc and used this knowledge in the assignment. These courses allowed me to explore the world of digital forensics and
						grab the foundation of knowledge for future studies.
						
						<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During this semester, the world is facing tremendous changes. Because of COVID-19, all my courses are conducted in a
						completely online way. Compared with traditional face-to-face courses, online courses are more challenging and require
						our adaptability to different learning environments and the ability of time management. Although I cannot communicate
						face-to-face with my classmates and actually operate the equipment for digital forensics, such as write blocker, online
						courses still let me learn a lot of interesting and valuable knowledge. Overall, this is a unique, high-intensity, and
						challenging semester.</p>
